## WeatherPy

#### After examining and analyzing 586 different cities with latitude from -180 to 180 and longitude from -90 to 90, the following results were obtained:

- Conclusion 1: Southern Hemisphere climates tend to be slightly milder than those at similar latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. This is because the Southern Hemisphere has significantly more ocean and much less land water heats up and cools down more slowly than land.

- Conclusion 2: Highest temperature is found at 0 latitude and as the latitude increases or decreases, temperature drops. This happens as the equatorial region receives sunlight straight with less or no angle due to the curvature shape of the earth.

- Conclusion 3: Latitude doesn't have a strong influence on wind speed. The speed of the wind is controlled by the strength of the air pressure gradient, the stronger the pressure gradient the higher the wind speed.
